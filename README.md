# Insights and README

Files included:
- insights.txt : Contains 3â€“4 concise insights derived from a sales/dashboard analysis.
- README.md    : This file, describing the contents and suggested next steps.

How to use:
1. Open `insights.txt` to see concise insights you can paste into reports, presentations or emails.
2. Use the insights as talking points in your executive summary slide or LinkedIn update.
3. If you want numeric KPIs, run the dashboard export (CSV or Excel) and provide the numbers; I can convert these qualitative insights into quantified observations.

Suggested next steps:
- Export the dashboard data (CSV) and share it here; I will produce data-backed insights with exact figures.
- If you want these insights tailored to a specific audience (executive, analyst, marketing), tell me which one and I will rewrite them to match tone and level of detail.
